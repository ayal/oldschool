A question we all asked a million times - nuschool" width="1024" height="512"></a></p>
<p>You’ve found some price lists. Are they relevant for you? Are they relevant for this particular project? Can you use it as-is?</p>
<p>You then think of your former projects. You charged X for a website design, and Y for creating those restaurant menus. What can you deduce from this? You’re not sure.</p>
<p><strong>And indeed, how much SHOULD you charge for designing that project?</strong></p>
<p>This must be the single most frequent question creative freelancers ask. And it seems like no one out there is sure what to do.</p>
<p>Guess what? We’ve built a <a href="http://thenuschool.com/how-much" target="_blank">super cool tool</a> that will help you answer it. If you got no patience, just head <a href="http://thenuschool.com/how-much" target="_blank">there</a> and start playing. But if you want to understand what stands behind this tool, bare with me for a little longer.</p>
<h3>What’s wrong with price lists?</h3>
<p>I used to have my own fixed price list. For designers that would look like this one:<br>
1. Designing a logo =  $XX<br>
2. Designing a W<span id="ef0b898e-8976-4386-9959-863ae9dc106e" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="19c9597d-3597-4731-8e78-df9d93de2ea4" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">ordpress</span></span> website design with 5 templates = $YY<br>
3. Designing an app =$ZZ<br>
<span id="a36c7d63-fa02-4c47-a3b4-f155e2cc3ae4" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="80e49bd1-57ea-4c6b-af46-082c274f293f" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">and</span></span> so on…<br>
(It’s more detailed of course, but you got the point)</p>
<p>My price list was based on what I charged for my former projects, and on data my colleagues shared with me. Once in a while I updated it. Many freelancers and design studios I know use such a price list, so I thought I should too.</p>
<p>One day, sitting at my favourite cafe, Shelly the waitress approached me.<br>
“You’re building websites, right?” – she asked.<br>
“Sure” – I said.<br>
“So… I’m in a band. We need a simple website – how much would you charge for building us one?”.<br>
She put on her cutest face.<br>
“Well, I usually take…”<br>
I couldn’t finish that sentence. I know exactly how much a waitress earns in this cafe. So I know she couldn’t afford my services.<br>
“Listen, let’s sit together for an hour or two. I’ll show you how you can build your own website for free. There are a few platforms just for what you need.”</p>
<p>I felt bad asking her for money.</p>
<p><a href="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pablo-31.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1198" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px  #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px  #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px   #000; ; behavior: url(&#x27;http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php&#x27;); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pablo-31.png" alt="Price lists are not the solution. Set up your price according to the size of the client. - nuschool" width="1024" height="512"></a></p>
<p>Walking out the cafe that day, I understood something about pricing. I couldn’t ask hipster-musician Shelly for her money. But if the manager of a large company would ask me to build him a website, I should charge him twice my usual rates.<br>
Why? <span id="5b86a1f8-7f7c-452e-ac20-072943f01c6c" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="116309e8-bf00-4f02-9ad8-d42d237a7d5f" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">because</span></span> he has the money. Just like Shelly doesn’t. These are values I have – and <strong>they are not included in my <a title="What I learned about pricing while being stuck in traffic" href="http://thenuschool.com/what-i-learned-about-pricing-while-being-stuck-in-traffic/" target="_blank">pricing</a> as a factor. </strong>I do not consider myself a socialist or something, I just want money from whoever has it.</p>
<p>I was discussing it with <a href="http://thenuschool.com/about" target="_blank">my mates</a> at the <span id="f7d09f2b-45eb-4769-bdb4-04daf909be39" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark"><span id="3ee5a2f3-8027-4f04-bee1-a22bcf5310fb" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">nuSchool</span></span>. Apparently they felt the same. There are many factors we never include in our <a title="The Pricing Class" href="http://thenuschool.com/the-pricing-class/" target="_blank">pricing</a>. And we should.</p>
<h3>“I wouldn’t do it for a million bucks”</h3>
<p>We all have red lines. Things we’d never do – not even for a million bucks.<br>
Well<span id="1f9a6958-b7f7-4438-9387-6b2d024aa9c8" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">…</span>as Demi Moore showed us <span class="itemprop">in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ehdAEyAGBEc" target="_blank">Indecent Proposal</a>, that is arguable.</span></p>
<p>What do you do when you need to write a proposal for a project that will make you hate yourself? I’ll tell you what I do. I give it a sky-high price.<br>
For example, I have a personal problem with dating websites. I think they are awful. So if someone asks me to build one, I would price it really high. So high, that I would probably not get the job. I don’t feel bad if I lose this project, because I didn’t want to do it anyway. And what if the client wants to <a title="The Pricing Class" href="http://thenuschool.com/the-pricing-class/">pay me</a> that much? Well, then I might be able to quiet my inner-voice.</p>
<p><a href="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pablo-32.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1199" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px  #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px  #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px   #000; ; behavior: url(&#x27;http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php&#x27;); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pablo-32.png" alt="Try to work on projects that you like. Otherwise give a sky-high price - nuschool" width="1024" height="512"></a></p>
<p>Just to be honest, I do have a real red line. It’s gambling websites. Those make me puke, and not even million dollars will change my mind. I mean, not even half a million. Or is it $100K?</p>
<p>And the other way around. When someone offers me a project that could change my life – I price it not-so-high. In order to work with people I admire, I’m willing to use my lowest rates. <span id="940aaeb2-75a6-42d7-9a3f-18e9f3936f46" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">It</span> worth more than the money. Though, I’d still ask for what I need to survive. I can’t be creative when I imagine my landlord’s face in front of me.</p>
<h3>Money can motivate me <span id="15be721d-9ba2-40f7-95f9-30fa8bbed764" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">get</span> out of bed</h3>
<p>Sometimes I need to send a proposal for a super-boring project. I can’t imagine waking up in the morning to this boredom. Like when I had to build a news website for some old guys in Washington. They were nice people, but the website wasn’t anything cool or funky. Quite the opposite.</p>
<p>Should I turn it down just because it’s boring? Not at all. If I get enough money, I’ll have the motivation to get up in the morning and start working. And vice versa – if this is an awesome project – I can live with less. My motivation is then built from loving what I’m doing.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-1183" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/pablo-21.png" alt="Money can motivate you get out of bed - nuschool" width="1024" height="512"></p>
<p>And what about my reputation? Don’t forget that the projects you’re working on, are the ones you’ll have in your portfolio. Those projects will attract the same type of <a title="Save Yourself From Endless Client Requests" href="http://thenuschool.com/save-endless-client-requests/">clients</a>. As they say: “shitty projects attract <a title="These Client Stories Will Make You Cry With Laughter" href="http://thenuschool.com/client-stories-will-make-cry-laughter/">shitty clients</a>”. So I’m charging more to work on a project that I won’t put in my portfolio. I have to compensate myself for not doing something that can push my career forward.</p>
<p>I mean, it’s not like I’m telling the client “you’re project bores me, hence I want twice the money”. Instead, I’m just taking a risk by putting a higher price. If I lose it – maybe it’s for the better. At least now I’m free to hear about other opportunities.</p>
<p>And if I get the project – I’m paid well enough to give up other potential projects.</p>
<h3>“How much should I charge for designing?”</h3>
<p>So I’m not using price lists anymore. How do I calculate my prices then? With three simple steps:</p>
<p>1. I have calculated my hourly rate. This is the <span id="b1636e6e-fb3b-465c-9ab6-fdc640eaf9f3" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">rate</span> I need to get, in order to maintain my lifestyle. I use this <a href="http://motivapp.com/freelance-hourly-rate-calculator" target="_blank">brilliant calculator</a> for this.</p>
<p>2. I then estimate the amount of hours I need to work on this project. I add extra hours for meetings, emails, change requests, etc. In my <span id="85a13090-bc05-45b1-9161-7ac644587167" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">case I use</span> 30% extra for the overhead.</p>
<p>3. Then I add the rest of the factors – just like I described before. Is it a boring project or a dreamy one? Will I use it in my portfolio, or I’d hate myself doing this?</p>
<p>We all use this method at the <span id="1792eef5-38ad-4f8e-9ea5-4ac4673aa80c" class="GINGER_SOFTWARE_mark">nuSchool</span>.</p>
<p>So we decided to <a href="http://thenuschool.com/how-much" target="_blank">build a tool</a> for this purpose. Answer five simple questions, and you’ll know how much to <strong>charge for designing</strong> a website, an app, branding, etc. Here’s a snapshot:</p>

<p>“You should take yourself more seriously”, a Zen monk once told me. The biggest problem with using a price list – is that it doesn’t include YOU in the picture. You are not a robot. Don’t price your work without including factors that take into account your feelings, motivation, and the value of your future.</p>  </div> </article> </main> <footer data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <img src="/images/nuschool-black.png" width="64" height="64" data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte> <br data-astro-cid-sz7xmlte>
