<p><span style="color: #000000;">This week’s question comes from Fern, who wants to know how involved you should be in <strong>setting up a website hosting</strong> for your client</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Fern wrote:</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Lior,</span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Thank you for writing an excellent, straight forward article [referring to <a href="http://thenuschool.com/create-a-wordpress-website-just-15-min-no-coding-needed/" target="_blank" style="color: #000000;">Create a WordPress Website in 15 mins</a>]. WordPress has always been somewhat of a mystery – but you explain it very simply (I enjoy your casual writing style). </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">One question I have is – how do you go about setting up a wordpress site for a client – do you have them purchase the hosting and domain or does the designer take care of it all? </span></em></p>
<p><em><span style="color: #000000;">Also, would I host multiple clients websites all on one host account? or do they each need separate hosting accounts? Thank you for sharing your knowledge with the world.</span></em></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Here’s my response:</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Hi Fern, thanks for your warm words!</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Your question is great. On the one hand, you don’t want to purchase things for your client. It feels awkward to use your credit card buying services for someone else, right?</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">On the other hand, your clients might not know how to do that themselves, which means they’d be happy if you help them with it. Hey, that’s more value you can give – meaning you could earn more. Nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It took me a while (and quite a few trials) to figure out the best strategy for this one. I think I have a winning formula – and I’d love to share it with you. Here’s the whole deal.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Hosting is a long time relationship</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You don’t want hosting to be your responsibility. The reason is that it is a recurring payment that you don’t want to take care of forever (or until your clients’ website dies with the end of the Internet, hence, the end of the universe known to mankind).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Other than the recurring payment, hosting is a long-term thing. Your client might want to upgrade to a faster or bigger server, might want to migrate to a different hosting provider, change domains, etc. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">If you’re the one responsible for it, it means you now have a long term relationship with that client, without getting paid. Not a good idea.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Setting up hosting is a great way to provide more value</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Then again, most of my clients are not technical at all (to say the least), which means they have a hard time setting it up themselves, and they will often ask for my help anyway. Sounds like a business opportunity!</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">But it takes them ages to do that themselves</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In addition, usually it takes them ages to decide which domain name they’d like to have.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">They think it is their most important decision (which is wrong thanks to everyone using Google), and they can spend two weeks going back and forth with cute/boring/crazy names for their cats pajamas website. This will hurt your ability to start working on the project – so you don’t want that.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">Lastly, even when they have the domain name ready, you might want to test the website before you publish it to the world. So hosting the website on the real domain is not a perfect solution for testing anyway.</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">So here’s my winning formula that I’ve been using for years now:</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">First, I make sure that the contract with my clients includes a paragraph that explains that hosting is THEIR responsibility to set up and maintain. I don’t want that on my shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I have my own hosting account, where I set up websites for my clients, temporarily.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">It’s a single inexpensive account (<a href="http://thenuschool.com/create-a-wordpress-website-just-15-min-no-coding-needed/" style="color: #000000;">here’s how I set it up</a>), that can hold as many websites as needed at a very low price. I set up their WordPress on my account, and use it for testing until they decide on a domain name.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">When the website is almost ready to be published to the world (=Google), I help my clients set up a hosting account for their real and finished website. I ask them to use their credit card (I either send them the link to purchase or help them over the phone).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">I then transfer the WP from my domain to their domain. This step might be annoying at times, but still worth the pain since I’m being paid for that (what? oh yes!).</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">BTW, it’s less painful when you move the WordPress on the same hosting service (e.g. Bluehost to Bluehost or 1and1 to 1and1).</span></p>
<h3><span style="color: #000000;">Get paid for your setup services</span></h3>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">In my proposals (and then if I win the project in the contract), I include “set up hosting for testing”. I charge them for two things:</span></p>
<ol>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">The time their website sits on my personal account. This covers my hosting hosts (even though those are <a href="http://thenuschool.com/create-a-wordpress-website-just-15-min-no-coding-needed/" style="color: #000000;">super cheap</a>)</span></li>
<li><span style="color: #000000;">Helping them set up their own hosting account – I include those hours on my proposal as an option.</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span style="color: #000000;">You know what? I’ve had zero clients who wanted to set up hosting themselves, and so they are happy I’m there to help. And I’m happy I’m there to get paid.</span></p>
