<p>The other day, while mentoring Startups in an accelerator, I saw this sentence on the wall:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5463151ee4b0cbd962f27f1a/t/5953c28e78d171b8a62ae5f3/1498661524256/?format=1500w" alt=""/></figure>



<p><em>YOU SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP.</em></p>



<p>The thing about clichés is that they look really good when they are written with big letters on walls. It&#8217;s more difficult to argue with them that way.</p>



<p>And actually, should we argue with them at all? I mean, someone has worked really hard so this sentence becomes so popular. So popular &#8211; it became a cliché&#8230;</p>



<p>One that with the wrong interpretation, could do some damage.</p>



<h3>To Give Up or Not To Give Up. That is the question.</h3>



<p>While participating in those mentoring sessions, I&#8217;ve heard many great ideas and some really bad ones. I&#8217;m not speaking about my own opinion about them, but only to the dry numbers.</p>



<p>For some of those ideas, or better, for some of the entrepreneurs behind them, I would definitely not advise this cliche, even if it&#8217;s written on a wall. I think some ideas should be given up on.</p>



<p>Being in love with your idea, even when reality shows you it&#8217;s not a good one,&nbsp;will make you pay dearly. I know because I did it myself several times. Even more so, sometimes it&#8217;s harder to give up on your idea than to just continue and hope that the reality will change.</p>



<p>But giving up on a bad idea, does not mean you should give up completely. You don&#8217;t have to give up your desire to do something great in your lifetime. And you should not give up on the desire to solve real problems, that real people have.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a matter of what you give up on, and what you&#8217;re not.</p>



<p>Some things in life &#8211; not only bad ideas, but also mal friends, a workplace that doesn&#8217;t let me realise my potential, or even a woman I was in love with but stopped me from growing &#8211; those are things I&#8217;m happy I gave up on.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But things I believe in, such as my agenda, my values, and people who make me a better me &#8211; well &#8211; I should never give up on them.</p>



<p>Beware of cliches, even those which are written on walls. You should give up some of them.<br></p>
