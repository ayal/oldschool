<p style="text-align: left;">New Year&#8217;s is cleansing. It&#8217;s a chance to step back from the year you&#8217;ve had and figure out what you want to change &#8212; what you promise yourself you&#8217;ll make better, or different.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Reflecting ain&#8217;t easy, so we&#8217;ve called up some of our favorite designers to tell us about the year they&#8217;ve had and what they want from next year. Remember our post for<a href="http://thenuschool.com/designers-new-years-resolutions-2015/" target="_blank"> 2015 resolutions</a>? We&#8217;re back for some feedback on how those went, and how 2016 is going to look instead.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">You&#8217;ll laugh, you&#8217;ll cry, you&#8217;ll make some goals. Here goes <strong>The nuSchool 2015-2016 Roundup Extravaganza.</strong></p>

          <p class="postparagraphtext nuyeartext">'My book is moving forward. I have a very solid plan; lots of post-it notes and a folder stuffed full of resources, ideas, and first drafts. 2015 was such a crazy year with unmissable opportunities that I didn’t have as much time as I’d like to spend on it, so the book's still in it’s infancy but it’s happening! For 2016 I want to focus on growing Logo Geek as a community and personal brand, and to continue to progress my book in the little time I have! I’m keen to create more logo resources to help young designers learn, and to also start an email newsletter to help designers keep up to date with logo and branding news. 2016 will be an exciting year for sure!<i>'</i></p>

          <p class="postparagraphtext nuyeartext">“This year, Mostly Serious completely revamped our process to help both ourselves and our clients better understand each project. Our single best change was the addition of a very early research and planning phase that we break out as a separate project. This lets us devote proper time to better define the product and set goals prior to jumping into the heavy lifting. Our goal this year—using our process improvements—is to work smarter and faster to build more complex products that solve bigger problems for our clients and our internal products. We also want to go on more field trips. Field trips are awesome.”</p>

I'm planning to finish my book, collaborate with some amazing people, and hopefully get a fun project I've been kicking around out the door.

I averaged more than 1 a month and my goal was 1 a month. :) My goals for 2016 is to build out more side projects. My partner in crime, Carlos Gavina, and I already have things geared up. The two of us build as North Parallel. Our first project together, a Freelancer Secret Santa called Because  just wrapped up, and have a couple other ideas in motion as well – which we plan to release in mid to late 2016.”</p>

          <p class="postparagraphtext nuyeartext">'2015 was a great year for me, transformative in every way possible. I spent a great deal of 2015 'preparing' my life and my health, my relationships, working towards goals, that will really serve me in 2016 with my ultimate goal. In 2016 I am really going to live in the moment, and enjoy the fruits of the past few years of labour. That doesn't mean sitting on my laurels, to me, that means getting even more motivated and excited to make things happen, each and every day, week, and month. If you aren't moving you are going backwards, but if you aren't enjoying your movement - what is it that you are doing?'</p>

Additionally I want to reduce the number of projects I'm working on in parallel and instead spend more time on polishing and documenting current projects.”</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;">Happy nuYear!</h2>
<p><em>Update, 6 January: </em>NuSchoolers, we made a mistake. This post doesn&#8217;t include women, and that&#8217;s a huge oversight. The nuSchool was created to empower designers, and empowering women is a huge component of that. We&#8217;re sorry, and we&#8217;ll do better by you &#8212; for the rest of 2016, and way beyond that.</p>
