<p>Let&#8217;s talk productivity.</p>
<p>Productivity only works when you have the willpower to start moving.</p>
<p>No matter how much work piles up, without the burning fiery need to get it done, the productivity engines can&#8217;t get started. Like pita without hummus, or Chandler without Joey, productivity falls flat without willpower.</p>
<p>Recently, my wife and her brother flew out for a visit to New York, leaving me to watch over the house and our son &#8212; on top of my usual client work. This is how I got everything done &#8212; and how I keep myself on track.</p>

<p>How do you get everything done in less time?</p>
<h3>Setting Priorities &#8212; The Big Picture And The Little Pictures</h3>
<p>The only way to get started is to get started.</p>
<p>At the end of every weekend, I make a list in my notebook of my priorities for the week &#8212; not just work, my whole life, wife, child, and friends included.</p>
<p>Once I know what the &#8216;big picture&#8217; looks like, I can break it down into details. Every day gets its own box in my sketchbook, and then I can split my responsibilities by the day &#8212; making sure to schedule all of my work, but also the other important things in life.</p>
<p>Sometimes our devices feel so intuitive that we forget that they, you know, aren&#8217;t. Writing in a sketchbook, however, is &#8212; it&#8217;s a hands-on process, without having to turn anything on or enter any passwords.</p>
<h3>Keeping Track Of Time</h3>
<p><strong>Taking breaks:</strong> I use the <a href="http://pomodorotechnique.com/" target="_blank"><strong>Pomodoro Technique</strong></a> to stay motivated throughout the day. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management technique based on the belief that the human attention span is only ~25 minutes (shoutout to TED Talks, whose talks each clock in around 20 minutes).</p>
<p>Working with our short attention spans, instead of against, the Pomodoro Technique advocates for dividing the day into 25-minute blocks, called pomodoros, with small breaks in between and occasional longer breaks. This makes work more manageable and tasks more doable.</p>
<h3>Finding, Getting, and Keeping Willpower</h3>
<p>Some people have more willpower than others. That&#8217;s a fact. <strong>However,</strong> your habits also have a huge impact on how much willpower you have.</p>
<p>This is where your physical starts to impact your mental. Eating a lot of sugar? Not going to do you any favors here. Keeping your hormones/blood sugar regulated, without lots of ups and downs, will help keep your overall energy level in your favor and will make you more productive.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not sexy, but it&#8217;s the truth. Eating well, sleeping enough, and exercising have a huge impact on what your overall productivity is going to be like. Taking care of yourself in the details will keep your brain sharp and your nap-needs low.</p>
<h3>A Final Word On Productivity and Willpower</h3>
<p>Everyone has a different set of tools and techniques that works for them &#8212; these are what I&#8217;ve found do it for me. As long as you have a system that keeps you organized and focused, you can play around within that to get to your optimized, longest-lasting productivity center.</p>
