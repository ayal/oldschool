<p>I don&#8217;t like being sold to.</p>
<p>All of those advertisements that say, <em>buy me, buy me</em> &#8212; that&#8217;s gross. It&#8217;s not how I like to be informed about a product, and it&#8217;s definitely not how I want to sell my services to future clients.</p>

<h3>How I Approach The Client-Freelancer Relationship</h3>
<p>When talking to a potential client, it&#8217;s in your nature as a freelancer to convince them why you&#8217;re the best at what you do.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how a freelancer has to survive, right?</p>
<p><strong>Not exactly.</strong></p>
<p>Not every project is the right project, and not every client is the right client.</p>
<p>Instead of convincing clients that you&#8217;re the unequivocal best, make sure that the you&#8217;re the best fit for them &#8212; and that the project is a great fit for you, too.</p>
<p>In the ideal client-freelancer relationship, you as the freelancer aren&#8217;t the creative slave of the client; you&#8217;re brought in for your expertise to work with the client on elevating their project. <a href="http://thenuschool.com/dont-try-everyones-flavor-proven-pasta/" target="_blank">You&#8217;re not going to be the perfect fit for every project</a>, but you&#8217;re not going to want to take every project either.</p>
<p>In my negotiations, I&#8217;m not trying to say, <em>work with me! I&#8217;m amazing!</em></p>
<p>Instead, I tell them why I think it&#8217;s a good collaboration &#8212; what I like about them and their project, and why I have the insight and passion to help their team.</p>
<h3>Why Who You Are Is As Important As What You Do</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re a creative, who you are drives the work you do. It&#8217;s fair for your client to expect who are you to be a part of the work you deliver.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why when you meet a client, it&#8217;s unfair to them and it&#8217;s unfair to you not to bring yourself into that discussion.</p>
<p>Take the dollar signs out of your eyes before you tell them why you&#8217;d love to work with them on their project. What you should be doing here is giving them all of the relevant information to make the decision that&#8217;s right for them &#8212; because when you chose to freelance, you made the decision that&#8217;s right for you.</p>
<p>Ultimately, you don&#8217;t want to put yourself in a situation where the client is disappointed and you&#8217;re doing work you hate. It&#8217;s better to represent yourself honestly, so the client knows who they&#8217;re hiring and why &#8212; and you get an amazing testimonial and a project you love.</p>
