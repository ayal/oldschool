<p>If I say <em>Italy</em>, what do you think of?</p>
<p>Right, pizza.</p>
<p>But some of you have better taste than me, and you might have something else come to mind:</p>
<p>Pasta.</p>
<p>And where is pasta most popular in the world?</p>
<p>Italy!</p>
<p>Nah&#8230; just kidding. It&#8217;s the USA.</p>
<p>And where there&#8217;s tons of pasta, there are dozens of flavors of pasta sauce. That&#8217;s important <strong>because&#8230;</strong></p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m going to change your view on some things in life, using the winning <strong>pasta sauce analogy</strong>.</p>
<p>Ready?</p>
<h3>Who is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Moskowitz">Howard Moskowitz</a>, and why do I care?</h3>
<p>OK, so our story starts with a nice, roundish, super-smart guy named Howard Moskowitz, who disrupted the food industry in the US.</p>
<p>One day, Pepsi called Howard to say:</p>
<p>&#8220;Yo Howard, we want something called Pepsi Max. It&#8217;s like diet, but with a stupider name. Now we need you to tell us how sweet it should be. Meaning &#8211; what would be the perfect level of sweetness (aspartame) that would make sure the average American gets addicted to Pepsi Max?&#8221;</p>
<p>Howard was up for the challenge. Well, he gets paid well, so why not.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here&#8217;s what we should do&#8221; &#8211; he said to Pepsi &#8211; &#8220;let&#8217;s get thousands of people in a huge room, and let them drink Pepsi Max with different levels of sweetness (8.1%, 8.2%&#8230; 12%). Then we&#8217;ll crunch the numbers, and we&#8217;ll know what to choose.&#8221;</p>
<p>And so they did.</p>
<p>They gave tons of people free drinks (with different sweetness levels), and little notes to fill up; after a while, they gathered the notes, stuck them in Howard&#8217;s hand, and sent him to his hotel to crunch a million numbers.</p>
<p>Our Howard is excited. He does the whole thing, but then &#8211; to his surprise &#8211; the numbers look bad.</p>
<p>Why bad? Because Howard wanted to see a bell curve.</p>
<p>(Now just in case you&#8217;re not sure what a bell curve is &#8211; it means that the results of a test with many points looks like a little mountain &#8211; many people choose one number, and the further we go from this number, the less people who chose this number).</p>
<p>So Howard wished the numbers would look something like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div class="image-caption-wrapper">
<div class="image-caption">
<p>Then Howard could tell Pepsi, &#8220;Listen, the average American wants 9.5% sweetness. Now give me my money, see you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>But instead, Howard got something that looked more like this:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2593" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/IMG_20151222_111627.jpg" alt="omg graph nuschool" width="800" height="592" /></p>

<div class="sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html" data-block-type="2" id="block-yui_3_17_2_7_1450249842637_20460">
<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p>WHAT?!!! How can someone figure out the right sweetness from such results?!!</p>
<p>Bummer.</p>
<p>Howard and the guys from Pepsi were sure something was wrong &#8212; either the numbers, or the sweetness levels in the cups in the test, or whatever.</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t know what to do and so they just picked a number to go with.</p>
<p>Howard got his money, but so sad he was&#8230;</p>
<h3>Don&#8217;t be sad, Howard</h3>
<p>One sleepless night, Howard suddenly understood what the problem was.</p>
<p>The test was just fine. It was the way he viewed the food industry that was wrong.</p>
<p>He called the guy from Pepsi, and shouted:</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been looking for the perfect Pepsi.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re wrong.</p>
<p>You should be looking for the perfect Pepsis!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;???&#8221; &#8211; answered the confused guy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes! Yes! There is no one single perfect Pepsi. There are perfect Pepsis!&#8221;</p>
<p>The guy didn&#8217;t get Howard so he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>But our Howard didn&#8217;t give up. He tried to explain his new eureka! to everyone, but no one really got him&#8230;</p>
</div>
<p>You see, back in the day, the food industry was guided by a simple, but ultimately incorrect, ideology: Make food and drinks that the average American will love, and then you&#8217;ll be super rich and sell a lot. And if we put many Americans in a room and ask them what they want to eat/drink, they&#8217;ll know what to tell you.</p>
<p>But one day, Howard gets a phone call from Prego (an American pasta sauce brand), and they believe in his idea, and want his help developing many perfect pasta sauces.</p>
<p>Howard asks them to create 45 different flavors, and he starts to travel the whole US with the sauces in his suitcase.</p>
<p>A few months later, Howard calls Prego to tell them they&#8217;re going to be rich.</p>
<p>So they listen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Listen. In addition to the plain and spicy sauces you already have selling, there&#8217;s a new flavor you have to make. And it will make you millions.&#8221;</p>
<h3>The Millions!</h3>
<div class="sqs-block-content">
<p>Howard talked about the &#8220;Extra Chunky&#8221; sauce.</p>
<p>Apparently, one-third of the audience really loved the Extra Chunky flavor. Which means that till now, 1 of every 3 Americans hadn&#8217;t had a chance to find the pasta sauce they love the most.</p>
<p>Because there&#8217;s nowhere you could buy anything else other than plain or spicy,  and in focus groups, no one ever said they want a chunky sauce. Maybe they didn&#8217;t even know chunky sauce existed.</p>
<p>So, Prego &#8211; being smart &#8211; created the chunky sauce. And that year alone, they made a pretty chunky $600 million!</p>

<p>Nice, right?</p>
<p>OK, so 30 years later, we now have 40 flavours for whatever food or drink we want. Too many? Maybe. But everyone has a beloved flavor.</p>
<p>(This beautiful story is told by Malcolm Gladwell &#8211; one of my favourite writers &#8211; in his <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/malcolm_gladwell_on_spaghetti_sauce" target="_blank">TED talk from 2004</a>.)</p>
<h3>Now, let&#8217;s talk about you</h3>
<p>Nice story, you&#8217;re thinking.</p>
<p>You made me hungry, you&#8217;re thinking.</p>
<p>But what&#8217;s the lesson?</p>
<p>So happy you asked.</p>
<p>The pasta story was just the way for you to realize that you shouldn&#8217;t try to be everyone&#8217;s flavor.</p>
</div>
</div>
<p>I mean, you can try to make everyone like you and your work, but that&#8217;s kind of a bummer. You&#8217;ll get what you want: Average work for average people who like your work in an average way.</p>
<p>Say, they&#8217;ll be 60% happy with you.</p>
<p>But what if you could choose to be a very specific flavor? What if you could make a smaller segment of the people to be 95% happy with you and your work?</p>
<p>And the rest of the people? Irrelevant.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re on our mailing list, you probably know I&#8217;m eating my own dog food. Some of my emails are provocative, or using swear words, or make fun of things, and mainly of myself.</p>
<p>Some people hate it, others think it&#8217;s not professional. I know this because they tell me, write me, get angry at me.</p>
<p>But the people who like it? Well, they REALLY like it. They send me emails to thank me for being so blunt and bold.</p>
<p>So what do you prefer? Do you want everyone to &#8220;kind of&#8221; like you? Or do you want just some of the people to REALLY like you and your work?</p>
<p>The faster you get to understand who is your audience, what is the type of clients that will really like you and your work, the better chance you&#8217;ll have succeeding at just being yourself.</p>
<p>And believe me, you can be pretty damn good at being yourself.</p>
