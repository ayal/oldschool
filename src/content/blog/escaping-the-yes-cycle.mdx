<p>Have you ever been bullied into taking a project?</p>
<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://thenuschool.com/freelancing-with-depression">after a pretty tough few months</a>, I took a project with a design agency.</p>
<p>The agency had offered me a full-time position a few months earlier, but I stuck to my freelance guns. When they couldn&#8217;t find someone they liked as much to join their team, they called and asked if they could be a client.</p>
<p>Super flattering, right?</p>
<p>Well, not really. When I came in to discuss the contract, in their eyes, it wasn&#8217;t so much a freelance project as a part-time job. They told me that their project was the basis of my schedule and my work; that I should think about them in the shower, because that&#8217;s when people tend to have their best ideas.</p>
<p>This would usually be a sign to run far, far away, but I liked their clients and thought with time we would establish boundaries &#8212; and I was too scared to say no.</p>
<p>After the colossal failures with clients I&#8217;d experienced a few months earlier, I was totally wiped out, and just wanted some projects that would give me financial security and peace of mind.</p>
<p>As we started getting into our first project, the client became more and more demanding. They wanted everything to be on their schedule: meetings scheduled the same day, phone calls at all hours, and deadlines popping up like groundhogs.</p>
<p>And then they disappeared. For two weeks, everyone on the team went MIA. No one answered emails, calls, or texts.</p>
<p>Turns out one guy was sick, one was on vacation, and everyone else &#8212; well, you know. Shit happens. But they wanted their two weeks back, and they wanted them STAT.</p>
<p>The bully I thought I could avoid was there waiting for me.</p>
<p>I explained that I had called, texted, and emailed, but all I got was radio silence. What was I supposed to do?</p>
<p>And that was it. My agency email was cut off, and the project was over. Unceremonious, and certainly not glamorous. I was paid, but only after yelling and threats.</p>
<p><strong>Why did I take the project?</strong> I knew what kind of people they were &#8212; but I thought I could change them. I thought it made more sense to take a long-term &#8220;secure&#8221; project than to look around for something else. What if there was nothing else? What if I would turn down this project and then never find work again?</p>
<p>Now I know better; I know it&#8217;s better to turn down nightmare people before they turn into nightmare clients. But I learned that on my own skin.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Being great at freelancing goes way beyond being great at what you do.</p>
<p>Of course, you have to be good at what you do; that goes without saying.</p>
<p>But, while you&#8217;re busy being good &#8211; and becoming better &#8211; at that creative thing, you also have to be an accounting master, a super networker, and some kind of project manager.</p>
<p>And a self-sufficient human being.</p>
<p><strong>You, my freelancer friend, are wearing a lot of hats. </strong>And I know that is exhausting.</p>
<p>And what kind of decisions do exhausted people make?</p>
<h3>Avoiding the monkey fight</h3>
<p>When I was a kid, one of my favorite books was <em>Caps for Sale</em> by Esphyr Slobodkina.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3453 aligncenter" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/hqdefault.jpg" alt="caps for sale" width="208" height="156" /></p>
<p>As the story goes, a lovely cap salesman would spend his days wandering about town selling caps off of his head. One day, after a long lifetime of cap selling, he sat down to take a nap under a tree &#8212; and when he woke up, his caps were gone.</p>
<p>Stolen by monkeys.</p>
<p>The salesman begged and pleaded, pleaded and begged, but monkeys are assholes and they wouldn&#8217;t give his caps back.</p>
<p>After a long fight, the salesman got his caps back. But he almost didn&#8217;t: and that&#8217;s the lesson.</p>
<p><strong>It&#8217;s better to avoid the monkey fight.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s a price to pay for spending your days carrying around a headful of caps; first and foremost being, an entire book is written about you without ever mentioning your name. You&#8217;re known as the cap salesman.</p>
<p><strong>But just as important: even the most astute salesmen make bad decisions when they&#8217;re tired.</strong></p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy to lose what you&#8217;ve spent your whole career building because you chose to take a quick snooze under a tree.</p>
<h3>Decision fatigue</h3>
<p>The paradox of being overworked is that the less brainspace you have left to make decisions and do stuff, the more likely you are to just say yes to everything.</p>
<p>Saying no takes a lot of energy. As a freelancer, the anxiety of turning down projects can be more daunting than the project itself. The fear of needing the money or not wanting to hurt someone&#8217;s feelings can make sleepless nights seem like small potatoes.</p>
<p>But then the cycle continues.</p>
<p>And maybe at the beginning you&#8217;ll be able to handle it all. Maybe you can carry all the caps.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t last forever, and eventually the exhaustion turns into bad decisions &#8212; and that nap under a tree is, in your case, missed deadlines, unanswered emails, or simply enough, bad work.</p>
<p>So, like we learned from <em>Caps for Sale</em>, it&#8217;s easier to avoid the fight than to convince the monkeys to give your caps back.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s how:</p>
<p><strong>1. Stay rested</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes, you&#8217;ll find a really good reason to stay up all night. Maybe you&#8217;re right before a vacation, or the client you&#8217;ve been chasing finally came through with something urgent.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s your call. And I&#8217;m not arguing against it.</p>
<p>What I can say, though, is figure out a way to stay rested while you&#8217;re going crazy.</p>
<p>Even if that means sneaking in a nap or two, or skipping a night out with your significant other. <a href="https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/sdd/why">Because sleep is incomprehensibly important.</a></p>
<p>As you get more stressed, you&#8217;re going to need more time to let your brain process what&#8217;s going on. Sleeping more seems counterintuitive, but it works. The time off is what your brain needs to function better while you&#8217;re deep in the shit &#8212; and you&#8217;ll find your clients thanking you for it.</p>
<p><em>PS. Any client who wants you to stay up late for them is probably a jerk anyway.</em></p>
<p><strong>2. Stay organized</strong></p>
<p>When it feels like the whole world wants your brain, the absolute worst thing in the world is to have your brain scattered in a million pieces.</p>
<p>This is my biggest struggle. Lior will ask me something, and in that moment, I&#8217;m 100% there with him! And I can do the thing! And I can even do three more things!</p>
<p>But as soon as I&#8217;ve walked out of his office, I&#8217;ve forgotten all of those things, because my brain is in twelve different places and I&#8217;m probably hungry.</p>
<p>This, I have learned, is not charming, and when you are this way for long enough, people start to notice. And it starts to piss them off.</p>
<p>In order to avoid clients who hate me, these are the three organization tools that keep my brain working:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Calendar</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>My life and brain live in Google Calendar. After spending three years fighting the work-life balance fight, I realized that the only way I&#8217;ll have a life is if I value my life as much as my work &#8212; so all of my important things, from birthdays to calling friends to client deadlines, go into my Google Calendar.</p>
<p>I use Calendar for general to-dos and things that have an actual time, so I can see what I need to do on a certain day and if my day is planned out well enough to make those things possible.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Google Sheets</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>After Google Calendar, the most important part of my brain lives in Google Sheets.</p>
<p>Deep in my Google Drive, I have a spreadsheet called <em>Projects </em>with three very important sections:</p>
<p><em>Projects </em>Where I list clients, projects, and payments on a per-month basis.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-3470 aligncenter" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-06-at-07.45.08.png" alt="" width="510" height="398" /></p>
<p><em>Pipeline </em>How I keep track of who I talk to when, and just as importantly, how they found me &#8212; because I have some friends who have earned themselves a few rounds of drinks.</p>
<p><em>Partners </em>When a client asks me if I have a designer/developer/project manager/unicorn to bring to a project, I usually do, and I don&#8217;t like to make them wait. My partners sheet keeps track of all of my freelance buddies, what they specialize in, and how available they are, so I know who to refer when.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inbox bundles</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As much as I love Google Suite, Gmail itself is the bane of my existence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the software itself; it&#8217;s the fact that email exists.</p>
<p>My inbox looks like what I imagine a salad would look like I invited all of my friends to a dinner party and told them to bring one ingredient for *something* and to show up whenever. My clients are currently spread across three continents, meaning that I&#8217;m getting client emails at all hours &#8212; plus Forever21&#8217;s neverending sales and my mom&#8217;s BarkPost forwards.</p>
<p>My mom refuses to stop sending me coupons for dog treats and I don&#8217;t want to quit online shopping, so the only solution is <strong>Inbox Bundles</strong>. In Gmail&#8217;s Inbox, you can designate <em>bundles</em> where emails from addresses you specify, or including certain keywords, automatically go.</p>
<p>So, every time I start working on a new project, I set up a bundle for the contact person&#8217;s email address &#8212; that way, I can be fairly certain they&#8217;re not stuck in email purgatory between Poem-a-day and Another Way To Green Smoothie!!</p>
<p><strong>3. Figure out if what you&#8217;re doing works</strong></p>
<p>It might be that you&#8217;re so overworked because you&#8217;re fighting a losing battle.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean that freelancing is a losing battle; you&#8217;re here, which means you&#8217;re trying.</p>
<p>I mean that <strong>maybe you could do it better.</strong></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re worried about money, chances are you&#8217;re not charging enough. It&#8217;s a mistake that every single freelancer has made, and some of us continue to make. And it has a really simple solution:</p>
<p>Charge more.</p>
<p>Okay, it&#8217;s not simple. That&#8217;s why we <a href="http://thenuschool.com/the-pricing-class?from=boldhome">put together a class</a> about how to do it. And <a href="http://thenuschool.com/value-for-money/">wrote a book</a>. But the principle is simple: learn how to ask for what you&#8217;re worth.</p>
<p>Money stress is the most exhausting kind of stress that a business owner can deal with, and it&#8217;s the kind of pressure that keeps you from doing your best work.</p>
<p>So if you find that you&#8217;re constantly freaking out about how to pay next month&#8217;s rent &#8212; it&#8217;s worth a shot.</p>
<h3>What I learned from the last person who kissed me</h3>
<p>I have a friend who has a crush on me. It&#8217;s cute and sweet and I&#8217;m very thankful that I&#8217;m finally not the friend with the unrequited feelings.</p>
<p>This friend came to my house the other night for coffee and a dog playdate, and as he was leaving, he tried to turn our goodnight hug into a goodnight kiss. And I was pretty surprised.</p>
<p>There was probably a graceful way to handle the situation, but because I&#8217;m me, I shouted,</p>
<p><em><strong>That was weird!!!!</strong></em></p>
<p>and sent him off into the night.</p>
<p>In the moment, I had two options: to tell him to back off, or to lean in and say yes.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m really happy I chose to be a weird freakazoid, because now I know with 100% certainty where my, and our, boundaries are.</p>
<p>I live in constant fear that whoever wants to kiss me is going to be the last person to ever want to kiss me, so I&#8217;m usually inclined to just go with it &#8212; but that feels shitty, and I usually end up feeling gross in the morning.</p>
<p>Now I know, even if the last person I kissed is the last person I&#8217;ll kiss ever, at least it went the way I wanted it to &#8212; <strong>and I didn&#8217;t just say yes because I was scared to say no.</strong></p>
