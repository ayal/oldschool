<p>Profuse sweating? Check.</p>
<p>Mysterious stain on my shirt? Check.</p>
<p>One solitary hair that refuses to be slicked down? Check.</p>
<p>Sounds like I&#8217;m meeting a client for coffee. Cue the anxiety.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to forget who your client really is. When your only communication is email and *maybe* the occasional phone call, the client quickly becomes 1D, made up of Gmail pings and dreaded phone notifications.</p>
<p>While this is happening, you&#8217;re becoming 1D for your client, too.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why we have face-to-face meetings.</p>
<p>Working from home doesn&#8217;t mean working alone. Meetings have value &#8212; serious value, the kind that makes you extra money and gets you tons of referrals.</p>
<p>You know that, as a freelancer, <strong>the human experience</strong> is a huge part of signing clients. Clients want to see your face and to trust your judgement, and meetings are a huge part of building that relationship.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve sent the Google invite, it&#8217;s the night before your meeting, and you&#8217;re petrified. How do you deal?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a few easy tricks I&#8217;ve picked up along the way that will help boost your confidence and make the meeting go smooth as buttah on a summer day.</p>
<h3>Practice makes perfect</h3>
<p>Pro tip: People like to laugh. Including your clients.</p>
<p>Getting your clients on your side is easy if you know how to make them happy. It&#8217;s science. Why? Because if their brains release happy chemicals when they see you, they&#8217;re going to want to see you more. That means more projects, more money, more respect, and more referrals.</p>
<p>So, before you meet your client, think about what you&#8217;re going to say. Think of funny stories &#8212; nothing political or sexual, thanks &#8212; and how you&#8217;re going to segue them into your project. Think about what your client likes and what you can bond over.</p>
<p>The point of all of this is to build a real human relationship with your client. They probably don&#8217;t want you to see them as the bearer of occasional checks, and you don&#8217;t want them to see you as a floating set of hands behind a laptop screen.</p>
<p>It might seem like overkill, but the rehearsal will help you understand your pace and your client&#8217;s interests better &#8211; and will help you build a better meeting framework for yourself.</p>
<h3>Make a new friend</h3>
<p>When was the last time you went on a first date with a new friend?</p>
<p>See, none of these in-person interactions are easy at the beginning. But they all have the same goal &#8211; to make someone else like you.</p>
<p>Treat your client like a new friend. It&#8217;s easy.</p>
<p>• Don&#8217;t talk about politics, sex, or religion yet. You&#8217;re both new to this playground, and it&#8217;s not time to go into those topics yet. Keep it light.</p>
<p>• Don&#8217;t be gross. Eat with your mouth closed, don&#8217;t chew gum loudly, and (probably) don&#8217;t eat sushi or spaghetti &#8212; but that last one might be a personal issue.</p>
<p>• Make yourself a repeat customer. Don&#8217;t drag the meeting on forever, and don&#8217;t spill your guts. Make sure your client (er, new friend) has to meet you again, and again, and again for the full scoop.</p>
<h3>Your grown up closet</h3>
<p>Dress the part. This is the easiest part.</p>
<p>One of my biggest fears is being &#8216;found out.&#8217; Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called &#8216;impostor syndrome,&#8217; when all of your accomplishments feel <em>less than</em> and you&#8217;re terrified that everyone will realize and it will all be over forever.</p>
<p>Getting over that isn&#8217;t so simple, but dressing like I&#8217;m over it is a good start.</p>
<p>When I go to meet clients, I make sure I&#8217;m always wearing a sort of uniform &#8212; all black, glasses, and flats. Why?</p>
<p>My clients know what to expect when they see me. They&#8217;re never (rarely) surprised. I&#8217;m consistent, and that makes them comfortable &#8212; and more importantly, it makes them feel like they&#8217;re in safe hands. They&#8217;re secure in our relationship, which makes them secure in my work.</p>
<h2>Finding the good parts/shameless plug</h2>
<p>Chances are that coffee meetings aren&#8217;t why you became a freelancer, but they don&#8217;t have to be a bummer.</p>
<p>With some careful thought and a tiny bit of planning, the freelancer in the stained shirt is going to sit this meeting out &#8212; and you&#8217;re back in control.</p>
<p>Want to feel even more in control? Market yoself.</p>
