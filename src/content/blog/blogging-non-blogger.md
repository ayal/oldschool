<p><em>20I&#8217;m not a writer!</em></p>
<p><em>Blogging is lame!</em></p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t have anything to say!</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s 2017, folks. The Internet is getting fuller every day. The only way to get out there is to&#8230;<em>get out there</em>. And the time is now.</p>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a natural writing talent or not, blogging doesn&#8217;t have to be time-consuming or otherwise dreadful. We&#8217;ve put together a guide to creating a blog and writing posts, so you can get started ahead of the game.</p>
<p>Read on for your key to blog city.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<hr />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>#1 Give &#8216;Em Something To Talk About</h2>
<p>Not to start you off on a bad note, but an estimated <a href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2015/27698/2-million-blog-posts-are-written-every-day-heres-how-you-can-stand-out" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2 million blog posts</a> are published every day. So, if you&#8217;re going to do this, you really have to commit. Before you start building your blog, figure out what you&#8217;re going to be writing about.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p><a href="http://thenuschool.com/dont-try-everyones-flavor-proven-pasta/">You&#8217;re not going to be everybody&#8217;s flavor</a>, and <strong>that&#8217;s fine</strong>. Even if .00001% of all the people on the Internet find your blog, that&#8217;s still like, 30,000 people. Basically, you have a lot of space to be you.</p>
<p>So, who are you? What are you trying to share with the world?</p>
<p>Your blog is a space for you to differentiate yourself. It&#8217;s where you&#8217;ve come to get excited. So, what&#8217;s the thing that you can talk about for hours? What do you care about that separates you from your competition?</p>
<p>Now, how can what you care about give value?</p>
<p>When I say give value, I mean give your future readers something that will help them. Your readers will become loyal readers if they think that you really care about them &#8212; and they&#8217;ll know you care about them if you write something that helps them.</p>
<p>If you want to write about how you built your business, <strong>show us. </strong>Show us graphs, screenshots, and emails. Tell us the story of your failures and what you learned.</p>
<p>Neil Patel, one of the most famous content marketers in the world, is a huge advocate of <strong>content that gives value to the community</strong>. His post about developing a successful blog, <strong><a href="https://www.quicksprout.com/2013/04/04/11-things-i-wish-i-knew-before-i-started-my-first-blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">11 Things I Wish I knew Before I Started My First Blog</a></strong>, includes screenshots of his actual Google Analytics dashboards, as well as his actual per-month cost breakdown for running Quick Sprout.</p>
<p>By giving us so much content, Neil basically guarantees himself returning visitors &#8212; meaning people come back to him over and over to see what he has to say.</p>
<p>And, duh, it gets him more clients.</p>
<p>Jacob Cass at <a href="http://justcreative.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JUST Creative</a> uses his blog in part to promote huge savings on really expensive software &#8212; something that strengthens the community, builds loyalty, and increases engagement/sharing on his other posts.</p>
<p><a href="http://justcreative.com" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3007 noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3007" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-11.13.12.png" alt="Just Creative" width="1025" height="326" /></a></p>
<p>Being useful means contributing what you can to your community. Find the place that you love to give from and make it happen.</p>
<h2>#2 Build The Thing</h2>
<p>Another Neil Patel-ism: <strong>Design is marketing.</strong></p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need a design degree to know that it&#8217;s way more fun to read on a website that looks nice. So, before you start writing posts, make sure you have a nice looking place to put them.</p>
<p>Depending on how good at coding you are, or how much money you&#8217;re willing to spend on having a blog created from scratch, your options are varied.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_3013" style="width: 741px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="www.tundiszasz.com/blog" rel="attachment wp-att-3013"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3013" loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3013" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-10.38.49.png" alt="Tundi Szasz" width="731" height="725" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3013" class="wp-caption-text">Tundi Szasz has an <a href="http://www.tundiszasz.com/blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">amazing blog</a> about the life of a freelance creative, but what makes it stick? Her amazing design and beautiful imagery.</p></div></p>
<p>If you&#8217;re coding illiterate and don&#8217;t have a budget to pay someone who is, start with <strong><a href="http://www.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Medium</a></strong>. Medium is a blogging platform that is purposely design-lite, choosing to focus instead on content &#8212; and it&#8217;s also where most of the popular content in tech/startup world lives, if that&#8217;s you&#8217;re audience.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re less techy and more trendy, head over to <a href="http://www.tumblr.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tumblr</a>. Tumblr isn&#8217;t as &#8216;professional&#8217; as Medium, but the design options are much more customizable; aside for a library of free and for-pay themes, you can edit almost every theme&#8217;s CSS to make it into the theme you want it to be.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to spend a small-to-medium amount of money on a website, check out website builders like <a href="http://www.wix.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wix</a>, <a href="http://www.squarespace.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Squarespace</a>, or <a href="http://www.webydo.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Webydo</a>. These three platforms are great if you want to build a website including a blog section, or if you want a more &#8216;standard&#8217;-looking blog without writing code.</p>
<p>If coding ain&#8217;t no thang for you, or you have the budget for a developer, then go <a href="http://www.wordpress.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">WordPress</a>. WordPress is totally customizable, and once you&#8217;ve created a template, super easy to manage &#8212; plus, there&#8217;s a plugin for pretty much anything you might ever want to do, or any goal you want to achieve.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re ready to be serious, treat your blog like a client and write yourself a proper brief. Once you know the <strong>goals, target audience, </strong>and <strong>look and feel</strong> that you want, you can build a design/concept that fits the people you want to find your blog, and that will ultimately make you money.</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve started writing, <strong>don&#8217;t forget the design!</strong> Using pictures/gifs in your posts will not only majorly boost engagement and sharing, but it will also bring you design-oriented peoples. People with good taste &#8212; isn&#8217;t that what you want?</p>

This not only gives a really personal touch to all of her posts, it also advertises her video skills &#8212; and sometimes the gifs, <a href="http://www.sivansaar.com/how-to-achieive-self-discipline/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">like this one</a>, are really, really mesmerizing.</p></div></p>

<h2>#3 Create A Schedule</h2>
<p>The guaranteed, never-fail, always-works trick for blog success is <strong>consistency. </strong>If you use your blog as an every-so-often channel for sharing your feelings, you&#8217;ll have a tough time building a following; however, if your people know that every Wednesday you&#8217;re going to drop a design truth bomb, you&#8217;ll be able to keep up the publicity for the whole week.</p>
<p>No one is expecting you to post every day, or even every two days, <strong>but it&#8217;s amazing if you can</strong>. <a href="http://writtent.com/blog/often-update-blog-data-driven-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Studies show that the more often you publish, the more readers you&#8217;ll have</a> (= more clients you&#8217;ll find = more money you&#8217;ll have), but don&#8217;t overwhelm yourself.</p>
<p><div id="attachment_3004" style="width: 1243px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://logogeek.uk/logo-design-blog/" rel="attachment wp-att-3004"><img aria-describedby="caption-attachment-3004" loading="lazy" class="wp-image-3004 size-full" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-10.47.05.png" alt="LogoGeek" width="1233" height="625" /></a><p id="caption-attachment-3004" class="wp-caption-text">LogoGeek blog</p></div></p>
<p>My recommendation is to commit at the beginning to publishing <strong>once a week</strong>. Especially if this isn&#8217;t part of your full-time job, once a week gives you enough time to write, edit, publish, and distribute.</p>
<p>Wait, distribute? Whaaaaattttttt? (See below)</p>
<h2>#4 Distribute/Profit</h2>
<p>Remember those two million posts I mentioned before? Shit. That&#8217;s a lot of posts.</p>
<p>Even if your posts provide amazing, in-depth content, with piles of tools and loads of shareable quotes, if you don&#8217;t float your post to the top of those two million other ones, <strong>no one will ever see it.</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.clementvouillon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clement Vouillon</a> put together an amazing infographic that explains content sharing: how you can do it on your own, and where you can put it to get the best effect.</p>
<p><a href="https://blog.kissmetrics.com/overcome-content-distribution/" target="_blank" rel="attachment wp-att-3006 noopener noreferrer"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3006 aligncenter" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/b2b-content-marketing-framework.png" alt="Kissmetrics content sharing infographic" width="600" height="1300" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The reason people create content is because content brings in money. That&#8217;s it. Content brings clients, content brings advertising, and content brings revenue share. Unfortunately, however, content that goes unseen is content that&#8217;s wasted. Distribution is the only way to make sure that someone out there reads what you&#8217;ve worked so hard on.</p>

<h2>If Writing&#8217;s Seriously Not For You &#8211; Here Are Some Other Options</h2>
<p>Okay, I get it. You made it all the way through that post, and you still don&#8217;t believe that blogging is for you. That&#8217;s fine.</p>
<p>You have options.</p>
<h3>Video blogging/vlogging</h3>
<p>Our Ran Segall <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN7dywl5wDxTu1RM3eJ_h9Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">does it</a>, and he&#8217;s not the only one. Vlogging is an A+ option for people who don&#8217;t like blogging (<a href="http://blog.ransegall.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">though Ran has a blog too</a>).</p>
<p>Vlogging allows you to dynamically share your opinions pretty much in real-time, with the same sharing and community options as blogging.</p>
<p><a href="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-11.52.48.png" rel="attachment wp-att-3010"><img loading="lazy" class="size-full wp-image-3010 aligncenter" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Screen-Shot-2016-03-28-at-11.52.48.png" alt="Flux" width="856" height="642" /></a></p>
<p>Ran uses his channel, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCN7dywl5wDxTu1RM3eJ_h9Q" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flux</a>, to post daily accounts of his travels, client experiences, and more. And, because you get to look at him and see him talk, it feels super-personal.</p>
<h3>Podcasts</h3>
<p>The podcast potential is unleashed!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not comfortable writing and even less comfortable in front of a camera, then podcasting is where it&#8217;s at. With a podcast, you can talk on your own, with a partner, or interview-style with others about whatever speaks to your heart. It has the benefit of personalization, like a vlog, but is also super-accessible and informal. Slightly less shareable than blogging and vlogging, but still totally reasonable.</p>
