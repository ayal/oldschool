<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“My target audience is everybody.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Have you ever heard someone say that?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This week I met an entrepreneur in the the wellness niche who was angry that she couldn’t find a designer that “got” her. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I ask them for a logo, and they make something purple. Don’t they get that wellness isn’t just for women?! It’s for everybody!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It reminded me of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCcx45gyLOQ" target="_blank">great opening to a Louis CK show</a>, where he says:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello Everybody! Actually, why should I say everybody? You’re not everybody. Actually, most people are not here. Most people are in China, actually. Actually, most people are dead, did you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What that entrepreneur tried to express is that her audience consists of both women and men &#8212; but that still doesn’t mean it’s “everybody”. A few minutes into our talk, we realized “everybody” is 20-60 years old, living in Manhattan, with high socioeconomic status, and into yoga and other wellness activities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I guess there are no more than 150,000 of them &#8212; but for sure not everyone, and not even close.</span></p>
<h2><strong>But it&#8217;s for everyone!</strong></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Entrepreneurs love to imagine that their product is a good fit for everyone, just like Google and Facebook are for everyone. They tend to forget that no product or company starts with the mainstream. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Every product, including Facebook, starts as a niche product with a few first users (often called “the early adopters”). If the product isn’t a great fit for those first users, if it isn’t cool and valuable enough for them, they will never use it and the product won’t get to the mainstream ever. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When entrepreneurs try to get everyone, they dilute their brand &#8212; and reduce the chance to actually excite someone. </span></p>
<h2><b>Cue your work</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our work as creatives is to help entrepreneurs focus and define their target market. Whether it’s a restaurant or an app, both have a target audience, and it’s not everyone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The better job we are at defining target markets, the better we can design. We can learn who their audience is and how they talk, behave, and live &#8212; what is the visual and virtual world they live in, what moves and influences them. With that, we can improve our client’s chance to succeed.</span></p>
<h2><b>Cue you</b></h2>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now let’s talk about you. Yes, you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You have to decide and understand who YOUR target market is. Too many creatives I meet think that their potential audience is everyone. If you can pay, you’re in. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s a huge mistake. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As your target audience grows, you dilute your own brand &#8212; and, as we learned above, you decrease your chances of actually exciting anyone enough to work with you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The more specific you are about who your client is, the easier it is to market yourself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I, for example, love working with technologies companies. And, to be even more specific, my target market is startups. Once I was able to define that, life got easier. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Clients that are outside of the startup world aren’t a potential client for me. I can learn where startup people hang out, speak their language, read the blogs they read, go to events they go to &#8211; and build my network this way. They see me as an expert in this niche, and refer me to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Many people, both clients and freelance creatives, are afraid to make this choice about choosing their target audience. It’s scary to limit yourself!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes you say: That’s who I am and these are the people I want to work with. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s not an easy thing to say. What if you’re wrong? What if tomorrow there’s a client that I miss because they’re not in this audience? </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like all good things in life, you can’t dance at two weddings. Want to be great? Be great for someone specific &#8212; and decide who you’re not good for at all.</span></p>
