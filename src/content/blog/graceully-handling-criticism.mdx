<p>Freelancing can be a real pain in the balls. Or the lady balls, in my case.</p>
<p>You had this shiny idea in your head of how it was going to go.</p>
<p>You wake up every morning in your California king sized bed. You swagger over to your window and look out from your penthouse apartment (because, obviously, you&#8217;re a genius at business), and get ready for a day filled with important business calls in which you might just solve that Fortune 100 company&#8217;s entire marketing issue — in 45 minutes.</p>
<p><strong>Because you&#8217;re the best.</strong> That sounds about right, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Now, this is <em>somebody&#8217;s</em> reality. Or close to it. I&#8217;m sure of it. And this post isn&#8217;t going to commiserate or tell you how, &#8220;It all just takes time, and it&#8217;s okay, life is tough.&#8221; Life can be tough, but you better be tough, too.</p>
<p>Instead, we&#8217;re going to do something a little more painful. And that thing is called <strong>reframing</strong>.</p>
<p>Tired because all those people you hit up for work said no or didn&#8217;t reply? Pissed off that a project that was <em>supposed</em> to be done three weeks ago is still dragging on? Terrified because you feel out of control?</p>
<p>Good. You&#8217;re just where I want you.</p>
<h3>Reframe the Problem So It&#8217;s Something Good</h3>
<p>Cognitive reframing, or cognitive restructuring, is one skill I wish I was better at.</p>
<p>People who are good at this can take something bad, like a client&#8217;s angry review, and reframe the situation so that instead of thinking negative things like, &#8220;I messed up so bad,&#8221; or &#8220;This is always going to be hard,&#8221; you think, &#8220;Okay, how can I fix these bad things,&#8221; and &#8220;He did say three positive points, so it wasn&#8217;t all bad.&#8221;</p>
<p><strong>Reframing can be the difference between constructive feedback and soul-crushing criticism. It&#8217;s all in how you look at it.</strong></p>
<h3>Calm down and analyze the situation</h3>
<p>Alright, so let&#8217;s take the bad client feedback as an example. Now, you&#8217;re not going to cognitively feel anything, but you physically will.</p>
<p><strong>It will probably be one of two reactions: you&#8217;ll get all hot and feel like you want to scream. Or you&#8217;ll get all hot and feel tears in your eyes.</strong></p>
<p>I used to do a really classy combination of both where I would cry while also trying to yell. It wasn&#8217;t pretty. (And no, I know what you&#8217;re thinking — I never did this with clients. However, the puppets that I dress up as my clients to role play conversations caught an earful.)</p>
<p>Anyway, you&#8217;re going to start <em>feeling</em> stuff. Take 10 deep, slow breaths to calm yourself down. Then think about the situation. Analyze it. What even happened that triggered the reaction?</p>
<p>Chances are, your client said something negative, like &#8220;too slow to respond&#8221;, and for whatever reason it struck a really raw nerve with you. <strong>But identifying exactly what part of the review started to upset you is important.</strong></p>
<h3>Recognize what you&#8217;re feeling and see what automatic thoughts come up</h3>
<p>Okay, now for some tough stuff.</p>
<p>Understand what you&#8217;re feeling. You got upset when he said that you were too slow to email him back, but how did the client bringing that up make you feel?</p>
<p><strong>It probably made you feel helpless because you&#8217;re overwhelmed, insecure that you can&#8217;t do a good job, or maybe even hopeless that you&#8217;ll never be better.</strong></p>
<p>You can write down these immediate thoughts that come up to help you work through the problem, or you can talk through them out loud.</p>
<p>Every time you identify a feeling, ask yourself why you feel that way.</p>
<p>Trust me, this works — I go through this anytime I&#8217;m upset and it helps me on the way to finding a solution.</p>
<h3>Find actual facts to support your feelings.</h3>
<p>Now, look at what actually happened.</p>
<p>As humans, we naturally have a negativity bias where the bad stuff overpowers the good stuff.</p>
<p>So your client may have said, &#8220;You&#8217;re too slow in responding to emails,&#8221; but also said things like, &#8220;I loved your designs,&#8221; and &#8220;You&#8217;re great at understanding what I need.&#8221;</p>
<p>What were the good points, <em>in addition</em> to the bad points?</p>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve done that, make a plan.</p>
<p><strong>You know that you&#8217;re great at some things, so what actions can you take to fix the bad spots?</strong> If responding to email is the issue, you could set up automatic reminders in your email to help you out.</p>
<h3>Reframing can change everything</h3>
<p>Reframing seems like such a simple thing that we wouldn&#8217;t need steps to do it. But it took me a lot of anxious and reactionary years to learn that the steps are what make it work.</p>
<p>Just like you have a strategy for your client process, you&#8217;ve got to have a strategy for your emotional process. Because freelancing is rewarding, but it can also be damn hard</p>
<p>A lot of times it feels like you, the person, is being critiqued or even attacked. And that has the potential to shut you down.</p>
<p>Being honest about the situation and how you feel is hard at first, I won&#8217;t lie. But I promise, <em>promise</em> that you&#8217;ll be more motivated, focused, and happier.</p>
