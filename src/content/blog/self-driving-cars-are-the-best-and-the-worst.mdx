<p>I got my driver license on Christmas 96&#8242;.</p>



<p>Being able to play a CD of the Beatles in my mom&#8217;s old Subaru, seemed like a cutting-edge technology back then.</p>



<p>Hardly had I known that 18 years later, cars will drive themselves.</p>



<p>I spent a lot of time and money on my driving lessons. But hearing that companies like Tesla and Otto and Uber and Google are developing self-driving cars &#8211; well, that actually makes me really happy.</p>



<h3>OVER A MILLION DEATHS BY CARS A YEAR</h3>



<p>To be even more accurate, in 2013 alone, the number was<a target="_blank" href="http://www.who.int/gho/road_safety/mortality/traffic_deaths_number/en/" rel="noreferrer noopener">&nbsp;1.25 Million</a>.</p>



<p>How crazy is that??!</p>



<p>Not that it is a car&#8217;s purpose &#8211; killing people &#8211; but what can you do &#8211; driving is dangerous. And being a pedestrian or a bike rider is even more dangerous.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s actually the only one between the top 10 causes of deaths that is not health-related. So you can die of AIDS, a heart disease or diabetes, but not so less likely you can die because of cars.</p>



<p>And self-driving cars will fix a lot of it. Firstly, we won&#8217;t need most of the cars we have today, because we&#8217;ll use self-driving taxis instead of owning a car. Less cars, less accidents.</p>



<p>Secondly, the driving algorithms will be so much smarter than us. Algorithms don&#8217;t get tired and drive, they don&#8217;t drink alcohol and drive, they don&#8217;t text and drive, and they are able to take decisions 10x faster than human beings. We have two eyes, but a driverless car could have ten cameras around the car.</p>



<h3>MORE TIME FOR LEARNING, WORKING, SPENDING TIME WITH OUR KIDS</h3>



<p>The best thing about driverless cars is that we&#8217;ll have more of the one thing we all need &#8211; time!</p>



<p>People are spending 87 minutes on average&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.reference.com/world-view/much-time-people-spend-driving-f93af41f3f2605ea" rel="noreferrer noopener">driving their cars a day</a>(!). 104 if they have kids.</p>



<p>Now that we don&#8217;t need to drive, we can use the time to do whatever &#8211; work, learn, entertainment, whatever.</p>



<p>I think it won&#8217;t be another 87 minutes a day, since there will be less traffic when we have less cars, but even extra 30 minutes a day is quite a lot.</p>



<h3>THAT&#8217;S GOOD NEWS, ISN&#8217;T IT? WELL, NOT FOR EVERYONE.</h3>



<p>Dying less is indeed good news for humanity. But driveless cars are also really bad news for loads of people.</p>



<p>Do you know how many Taxi drivers work in the US alone?</p>



<p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533041.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener">180,000</a>. And we won&#8217;t need them anymore.</p>



<p>Wait, it gets worse.</p>



<p>What about truck drivers in the US?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s ±<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533032.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.67 Million</a>. And we won&#8217;t need them anymore.</p>



<p>In Ohio State, the tests for self driving trucks have started&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://efficientgov.com/blog/2016/12/05/uber-self-driving-truck-columbus/" rel="noreferrer noopener">yesterday</a>.</p>



<p>Wait, it gets worse, worse. What about the delivery drivers like the ones who work for FED-EX or Pizza Hut, etc? There are around 150K of those.</p>



<p>And School bus drivers? There around 500K of those.</p>



<p>Won&#8217;t be needed anymore.</p>



<p>And we&#8217;re not talking 50 years from now, according to what we see now, it will start within a few years from now.</p>



<p>And the same thing will happen not only in the US, but all over the world. Technology spread faster than ever these days.</p>



<h3>WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO THESE DRIVERS?</h3>



<p>I have no fucking clue.</p>



<p>These people earn, on average, not more than&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes533041.htm" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50K a year</a>. Sometimes half of it.</p>



<p>Most of them will probably be unemployed. Bad for them, and bad for us &#8211; because unemployment is bad for everyone.</p>



<h3>&#8220;PHEW, I&#8217;M SO HAPPY I&#8217;M NOT A TRUCK DRIVER!&#8221;</h3>



<p>You&#8217;re not? Good for you.</p>



<p>But how about your job? Is it safe from technology? In the future I&#8217;ll be writing about many more jobs that are under a big risk. You&#8217;ll be surprised how many of what we do today can be done better, faster, cheaper &#8211; with robots/bots/software.</p>



<p>But let&#8217;s hold this for the future. For now &#8211; you might want to think &#8211; &#8220;How can I benefit from this inevitable change in the car market?&#8221;</p>



<h3>ON TO YOU &#8211;</h3>



<p>Well, let me give you a hint.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a quiz &#8211; say you found out that human beings will have 30 extra minutes a day to spare. And that they do it inside a driving car.&nbsp;</p>



<p>What could you create/design/market/develop that will be beneficial for them?</p>



<p>Maybe a new gadget that let them exercise in the car?</p>



<p>Maybe you can develop an educational tool that knows the distance to work (with the help of Google Maps) and automatically creates a lesson that fits the riding time?</p>



<p>Maybe you could create a new Youtube channel or a Podcast?</p>



<p>Or a dating app that connect random people that are currently also on the way to work?</p>



<p>Take the next few minutes to imagine how you can use your current skills with this new world change.<br></p>
