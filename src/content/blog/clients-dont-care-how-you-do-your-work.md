<p>You&#8217;re really good at what you do, you&#8217;re really talented, and you&#8217;ve got a great portfolio, so why aren&#8217;t new clients beating down your door?</p>
<p>Many times, when we&#8217;re on an initial call with a client, we jump right in to telling the client about the features of our services instead of the benefits we offer. We explain this awesome new typeface we&#8217;re going to use, or in my case, how I&#8217;m going to use my experience with behavioral psychology to understand the consumer.</p>
<p>Bored yet? Exactly.</p>
<p>We love what we do, so it&#8217;s exciting to us to talk about <em>how</em> we will do the work instead of <em>what the result</em> of the work will be.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t fall into this trap.</p>
<p>Make sure to highlight the benefits first so that your clients understand exactly what your service can do to help them.</p>
<h2>Benefits vs. Features</h2>
<p>You may be thinking, <em>What the hell are you talking about, Marisa? I do great work and that&#8217;s all my clients need to know.</em></p>
<p>Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not true.</p>
<p>The world is filled with wonderful and talented freelancers living PayPal deposit to PayPal deposit because they have no idea how to properly talk about what they do.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to be that starving freelancer, bumming a cigarette at your local dive bar and praying for a discount special on the PBR, you&#8217;ve got to understand the difference between benefits and features.</p>
<h3>What is a benefit?</h3>
<p>A benefit is <em>how your product or service helps the consumer.</em> It&#8217;s the problem that your product solves. The need your service addresses.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re selling online fitness coaching, the benefit you&#8217;re selling is a hotter body, weight loss, and better sleep.</p>
<p>Another example is the iPod. When they launched, their marketing highlighted this: 1,000 songs in your pocket. I want my songs, and I want them now. Enter iPod.</p>
<p>A benefit encapsulates the emotion surrounding the product. It&#8217;s how the product helps me, and how it makes my life better. Benefits are exciting and aspirational. They make people perk up and pay attention.</p>
<h3>What is a feature?</h3>
<p>A feature is <em>how your product or service works.</em> It&#8217;s the technicalities, the software, how the work is put together. And often, features are also kind of boring.</p>
<p>If we look at online fitness coaching again, the features would be workout plans with eustress training and plates full of vegetables.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re new to fitness, which one of these sounds better to you? A benefit you can understand, like weight loss, or a feature that you&#8217;ve probably never heard of, like eustress training?</p>
<p>To take another look at iPod, the feature of their product was storage for 1GB of MP3s. And even if you&#8217;re tech savvy enough to know that&#8217;s a lot of storage, the benefit of carrying 1,000 songs in your pocket is far more impactful.</p>
<p>The feature is the fact about the product. It&#8217;s how the product actually works.</p>
<h2>Ask Yourself the Right Questions When Selling</h2>
<p>When you&#8217;re on the phone with a client then, it&#8217;s important that you highlight the important benefit you bring.</p>
<p>Most of the time your clients won&#8217;t care about your seamless, unobtrusive, and beautiful design features. They care that your design generates more sales.</p>
<h3>What is their pain?</h3>
<p>The first thing you need to consider is what your clients pain point is. Maybe their site isn&#8217;t getting enough subscribers. Maybe they&#8217;re worried about working with a freelancer because the last one was awful. Maybe their customers are having trouble navigating their site.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got to figure out what the problem is before you can understand why they&#8217;re coming to you.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s use a short example. Let&#8217;s say that your potential client sells a productivity app. They want to talk about hiring you to work on the branding for their app, and that&#8217;s all you know before the call.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a lot to go on, so you&#8217;ve got to ask very pointed questions that get to the root of their need.</p>
<p>They <em>think</em> they just need help on branding, but what they actually need is most likely a more compelling way to get customers.</p>
<h4>The Question You Should Ask</h4>
<p>&#8220;So we&#8217;re going to discuss how I can possibly help you with your branding. What about your current branding don&#8217;t you like?&#8221;</p>
<p>The funny thing about people is that we think we know what we need, we&#8217;re <em>sure</em> we know what we want, but all we ever really know is what we&#8217;ve liked or disliked in the past.</p>
<p>So start with a question that&#8217;s easy to answer. A person can <em>always</em> tell you what they don&#8217;t like.</p>
<h4>Highlighting the benefit, not the feature</h4>
<p>Make sure you write down their answer, so that you know their main problems. Then ask yourself this:</p>
<p>&#8220;What about my product or service addresses these problems?&#8221;</p>
<p>Framing the question this way helps us avoid the feature pitfall. <em>What</em> the service accomplishes is very different from <em>how</em> it accomplishes it. People don&#8217;t care about the how. They don&#8217;t want to know about the technology. They want to know what it does.</p>
<h3>What results are they looking for?</h3>
<p>People do know what results they need in order to succeed. Maybe they need more subscribers. Maybe they need more people to buy a certain product on their site. It&#8217;s easy for people to tell you the results they&#8217;re looking for, even if they don&#8217;t know exactly how to get there.</p>
<h4>The Question You Should Ask</h4>
<p>&#8220;Imagine that you had new branding. What results do you get from this new branding?&#8221;</p>
<p>The client may not know exactly what the expect for their branding, but they do know what results they want, and what affect they hope it has on customers.</p>
<h4>Highlighting the benefit, not the feature</h4>
<p>Now it&#8217;s your job to explain how your service can help them accomplish that goal. So ask yourself:</p>
<p>&#8220;How can I explain what I will do to get them further toward that end result?&#8221;</p>
<p>Again, <em>what</em> you are going to do is different from <em>how</em> you&#8217;re going to do it. When I&#8217;m trying to help a client get more customers for a product, the <em>how</em> I do it is by creating an email marketing funnel. <em>What</em> I do is create marketing that gets the user base excited about the product.</p>
<h2>Don&#8217;t Be Blinded by Your Features</h2>
<p>As creatives we love our process, but we don&#8217;t always need to tell that to our client. I love the way words and phrasing work together. If you&#8217;re a designer, you probably love the way typefaces, color schemes, and software work together.</p>
<p>But many times our clients don&#8217;t care about this. They only care that it works, and they&#8217;re happy to offload worrying about <em>how it works</em> to you so that you&#8217;ll make something that <em>just works</em>.</p>
<h3>When to Talk About Features</h3>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not saying to back off of features entirely. You want to show that you know what you&#8217;re talking about, after all. So, after you&#8217;ve discussed the benefit you can bring, back this up with the features of your service.</p>
<p>Showing that you have industry knowledge helps create trust. For example, you want a copywriter who is easy to work with and is great at communicating (the benefit), but who also understands behavioral psychology when creating content for your consumers (the feature).</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re talking to people that <em>do</em> care about the feature side of it, bring the features into the conversation. Just don&#8217;t make the mistake of assuming that since your potential client is also into the latest software, that they&#8217;ll pick you based on that logic alone.</p>
<p>None of us are as logical as we&#8217;d like to believe, and talking about the benefit you bring will get you much further than just explaining the features of your service.</p>
<h2>Dig Deep to Find the Benefit You Offer</h2>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to ask many questions to understand the benefit you can offer for each of your clients. And remember that the benefit will be different based on what they&#8217;re trying to accomplish.</p>
<p>Whenever you&#8217;re struggling, and trying to decide if you&#8217;re talking about a benefit or a feature, ask yourself, &#8220;What am I really selling? What&#8217;s the reason my client is interested in this service?&#8221; For example, I don&#8217;t sell website content â I sell customer awareness. You don&#8217;t sell logos â you sell a story.</p>
<p>People purchase with their hearts as well as their minds, so make sure that you&#8217;re also addressing their emotions when talking to them. Let them know you understand why they actually need you, and what you&#8217;ll do to help them reach their goals.</p>
