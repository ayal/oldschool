<p>&#8220;I took Lior&#8217;s advice and created a proposal as a webpage, instead of sending a boring old PDF. The reaction was &#8220;Wow!&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>This is the story of <a href="http://tarahoover.com" target="_blank">Tara Hoover</a> &#8211; a web designer who started freelancing only a few months ago &#8211; and is already mastering the way to write proposals and win projects.  I asked her to share her win story with the nuSchool students. She didn&#8217;t say nay.</p>
<p><strong>***</strong></p>
<p>Meet Tara &#8211; a <a href="http://tarahoover.com" target="_blank">full-stack designer,</a> doing everything from logo design, branding, print, email/social media graphics all the way to web-design.</p>

<p><strong><i>Can you tell us a little bit about your freelance career?</i></strong></p>
<p>I am on week eight of being a full-time freelancer. I &#8220;moonlighted&#8221; for over 10 years while I worked for various employers but decided to take the jump earlier this year. So far it&#8217;s going great &#8211; and the nuSchool has been a big help!</p>
<p><strong style="line-height: 1.5;"><i>Thanks! Well, what was your biggest struggle with your creative business?</i></strong></p>
<p>Being a freelancer can be lonely, and I think as designers we&#8217;re naturally inclined to be self-deprecating and hard on ourselves&#8230; I ask myself several times a day, &#8220;Do I even know what the hell I&#8217;m doing here?!&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how much I HATE the up-front work. The thought of proposals and pricing are enough to make my head hurt.</p>
<p>I like the initial meetings (which are usually at a coffee shop or a good lunch spot!) and wish I could just start working right away.</p>
<p>I realize these steps are the most important but it&#8217;s the thing I want to do the least.</p>
<p><strong><i>How did our class catch your attention?</i></strong></p>
<p>After using <a href="http://thenuschool.com/how-much/" target="_blank">&#8220;How-Much&#8221;</a> and getting your emails every week, I knew the pricing class would be a valuable tool—and something I would enjoy too!</p>
<p>Being a visual person, it&#8217;s often hard for me to sit down and put into words what I&#8217;m doing. The class broke things down in a way that made it seem less daunting. I use both the proposal generator and pricing calculator religiously.</p>
<p><strong><i>The class is helping different people with different problems. What was it for you? </i></strong></p>
<p>For me I think it was the proposals. It&#8217;s what I struggled with the most and after taking the class I had much more confidence in my new process.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m now learning to listen to the client in a different way and seeing opportunities to add value where I probably would have missed before taking the class.</p>
<p>You guys have such a fun personality. I think the opening video of you all dancing was the best.</p>
<p><strong><i>Do you use what you&#8217;ve learned?</i></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely!</p>
<p>My first proposal after taking the class I took Lior&#8217;s advice and created a webpage instead of sending a boring old PDF.</p>
<p>Here are some screenshots from the website I created for the proposal (the prices and the client name are hidden for the sake of&#8230; you know.):</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-22-at-10.21.17-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2226" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px  #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px  #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px   #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Untitled-design-1.png" alt="Untitled design (1)" width="900" height="716" /></a></p>
<p>After showing it to several people, each time their reaction was &#8220;Wow!&#8221;. It really does make you stand out from the crowd.</p>
<p>I am now using the outline from the proposal generator for all of my proposals and I don&#8217;t price a project without using the calculator.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-22-at-10.21.17-AM.png"><img loading="lazy" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-2224" style="-moz-box-shadow: 0px 0px 10px 5px  #000; -webkit-box-shadow: 0px 0px  #000; box-shadow: 0px 0px   #000; ; behavior: url('http://thenuschool.com/wp-content/plugins/roundit/pie/PIE.php'); position: relative;" src="https://d1h06o8peg3yk5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Screen-Shot-2015-06-22-at-10.21.17-AM.png" alt="Screen Shot 2015-06-22 at 10.21.17 AM" width="900" height="585" /></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The checklist is also a great resource for making sure you&#8217;ve done everything you can to ensure a successful project.</p>
<p>My entire process has changed since the class and it&#8217;s made it all much easier to handle. I&#8217;m now thinking of ways to add the &#8220;extra&#8221; value and leverage it in negotiations.</p>
<p>Just this week I had to price a few projects and for the first time I wasn&#8217;t dreading it. And it took me about half the time too!</p>
<p><strong><i>What’s next for you?</i></strong></p>
<div>
<p>I&#8217;m concentrating on building my business and diversifying my client portfolio.</p>
<p>My goal is to secure a couple large clients with steady work that will give me the flexibility to fill in with smaller more creative opportunities. I&#8217;m working hard to get one (or two!) on retainer, just like Ran did with his $5,000/month client.</p>
<p>I have a few prospects that would work well in this scenario and I plan to pitch the idea soon.</p>
<p>When I quit my job just two short months ago I thought I&#8217;d have time to rebrand myself, update my website, and build up work slowly&#8230;but the exact opposite has happened! I&#8217;m busier than ever and enjoying every minute!</p>
<p>Without learning lessons from the nuSchool (class, emails, blog posts, etc.) I would not have the confidence or the know-how to think about my business this way.</p>
<p><em><strong>Stop bragging about us or I wouldn&#8217;t be able to post it!<br />
You&#8217;re the one who had the courage to try things out. It&#8217;s 95% of the work.</strong></em></p>
</div>
<p>You guys really have helped me a lot, and you deserve the kudos.</p>
<p>Thank you for taking important information but conveying it in a way that was easy (and fun) to digest. I can honestly say that yours are the ONLY emails I actually look forward to getting. Those animated gifs crack me up! :)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s spot-on content delivered <i>by designers</i> in a way that <i>designers</i> understand.</p>
<p>***</p>
<h3>So is it possible to raise your rates without losing your clients?</h3>
</div>
<p>Tara&#8217;s story doesn&#8217;t end here. She went on, sent the proposal, and in the end she won a retainer with that client. But that&#8217;s a story for another blog post&#8230;</p>
<p>If you feel that you need help with learning how to do it, we’re here to help. The Pricing Class will not only teach you &#8211; step by step &#8211; how to understand your value, present it to your clients, and convince them to go for it. It will also &#8211; as Tara stated &#8211; give you the confidence to do just that.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget &#8211; taking our class is risk-free, as we have a 100% money-back guarantee policy. Hundreds of <strong>web designers and graphic designers</strong> have already taken it. We’re on a mission to make the designers of the world earn more. Don’t stay behind:</p>
