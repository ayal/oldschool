<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If you’re starting your Google search with “best…,” you’re already in trouble.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know the struggle to find the easiest/friendliest/cheapest accounting software, font stores, time management tools, and whatever else you need &#8212; so we put together a list of resources, what we use as a team and alone to keep our brains and careers in order.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Sayonara to those hours spent searching for the tools you need to run your life. This is a list of what keeps us going, to be updated continuously.</span></p>

The tracking is super-precise, but completely customizable; you can show clients how long you worked on a project to the minute (and when!), or you can round up to the nearest quarter-hour. Harvest </span><a href="https://www.getharvest.com/add-ons"><span style="font-weight: 400;">integrates</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with Trello, Asana, Basecamp, and pretty much every other popular project management app around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"><em>Ran from The nuSchool says</em>: Webflow has completely changed the way I design websites. I used to work in Photoshop/Sketch and then send the files with specs to the developer &#8212; now I can build it myself, without writing a piece of code. Unlike Wix or the other website builders, I never use templates with Webflow, but build whatever I want from scratch. It&#8217;s not as simple as Wix, but the design possibilities are much more open. Totally worth the learning curve. Check out their <a href="http://help.webflow.com/courses" target="_blank">free video tutorials</a> to learn how to use it. </span></p>
