<h3>Are you a creative freelancer? Start here&#8230;</h3>
<p>We see creative people all around us living great lives: having a good work-life balance, making good money, working with great clients and creating amazing stuff.</p>
<p>Do you think those people are more talented than you? Or have more luck?</p>
<p>Probably not.</p>
<p>Here’s an alternative: you are dealing with problems that no one taught you the skills to deal with.</p>
<p>But what if you could actually learn how to better deal with clients?</p>
<p>Learn how to earn more money with the art you know how to create… What if you could increase your rates?</p>
<p>Learn how to better organize your time and get the important things done&#8230;</p>
<p>Learn to find more clients, better clients, who are fun to work with and are willing to pay you what you’re worth&#8230;</p>
<p>What if you could learn how to position yourself better? Differentiate yourself from other freelancers?</p>
<p>We think it is possible. Because we are doing it ourselves, and we are not uniquely talented or lucky. And we have a blast doing what we love to do.</p>
<p>This is what the <strong>nuSchool</strong> is about. A place where you can learn practical knowledge, and improve the way you work, feel, think and live.</p>
<div id="goodies"></div>
<p>We create content. Tons of it. Videos, tools, articles and images &#8211; to help you with the business side of your career. You never thought you have to learn business, but as a freelancer it’s not a choice, it’s a must. And guess what &#8211; it can be fun!</p>
