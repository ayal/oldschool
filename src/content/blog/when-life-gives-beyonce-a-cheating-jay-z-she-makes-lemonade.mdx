<p>And so Jay Z was cheating on Beyoncé and I get to write a post about marketing?!</p>



<p>Indeed so.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img src="https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5463151ee4b0cbd962f27f1a/t/5953c71478d171b8a62b222e/1498662703008/?format=750w" alt=""/></figure>



<p>In case you weren&#8217;t connected to the interweb in 2016, I&#8217;m sorry to be the one who tells you that the two birds of the hip-hop world had a fight. Here&#8217;s what happened:</p>



<p>Jay-Z was a bad boy. The queen was offended, then angry, then kicked him out, then decided to forgive him, let him back home and love him for ever and ever.</p>



<p>Oh, and one more thing &#8211;</p>



<h3>Beyoncé&nbsp;released a new album. Her best album ever which is also an amazing example for how to do marketing in the new world.</h3>



<p>Lemme explain&#8230;</p>



<p>But just before, let&#8217;s talk about you for a sec.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s a rather familiar situation &#8211;</p>



<p>Your phone is ringing. Unknown number. You might decide to pick it up.</p>



<p>Someone you do not know presents herself.</p>



<p>&#8230;</p>



<p>Now, how long would it take you to figure out whether this person is someone friendly or a salesperson trying to sell you something?</p>



<p>Less than five seconds.</p>



<h3>Your bullshit radar</h3>



<p>Over the last few years/decade, we&#8217;ve developed a Bullshit Radar. We can recognize advertising,&nbsp;marketing content or manipulated messaging within seconds. It feels as if we have a BA in Psychology.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Our brains recognize certain words, sounds or visuals &#8211;&nbsp;(who said &#8220;stock photos&#8221;?) &#8211; with advertising.</p>



<p>We smell inauthenticity almost immediately.</p>



<p>And the more advertisers are trying to be more clever and hide their true interests and motives, the better our radar gets.</p>



<p><em>Wait &#8211; weren&#8217;t we supposed to talk about Beyoncé?</em></p>



<p>Sure, wait a sec, I&#8217;m getting there.</p>



<p>Last week I gave a presentation at a seminar for the Ministry of Economy in Israel: &#8220;Transferring Marketing Messages To Customers Who Want To Listen&#8221;.</p>



<p>Was I showing them how to manipulate customers into listening to them? Or how to use psychological tricks in order to get more attention?</p>



<p>Nope. Quite the opposite.</p>



<p>I do not know how to manipulate customers (and honestly &#8211; I don&#8217;t want people to manipulate others so I would never do that anyway.)</p>



<p>And anyhow &#8211; manipulative marketing isn&#8217;t working anymore. Especially when your customers are intelligent.&nbsp;</p>



<h3>If you want me to buy from you, make me believe that you and your brand is one.</h3>



<p>We are in the era of authenticity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Because if you are not authentic, you&#8217;re on the Bullshit Radars. And rightly so.</p>



<p>This is why Beyoncé&#8217;s last album is a genius marketing move.&nbsp;It&#8217;s the most authentic thing she could come up with.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s called Lemonade and you can figure out why quite easily &#8211; life brought her lemons &#8211; her celebrity husband was cheating on her. She made lemonade &#8211; an album that was listed #1 on&nbsp;<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/50-best-albums-of-2016-w451265">Rolling Stone&#8217;s 2016 albums</a>.</p>



<p>The album tells the sour story &#8211; how she forgives her husband,&nbsp;brings him back home even though he&#8217;s a MOFO. She shows us how much she was broken,&nbsp;angry, weeping, and why despite all that she&#8217;s decided that HE is the one for her and how the whole story will only strengthen their love and relationship.</p>

<h3>Conventions <g class="gr_ gr_12 gr-alert gr_gramm gr_inline_cards gr_run_anim Grammar multiReplace" id="12" data-gr-id="12">broken</g> at once</h3>



<p>Here&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so authentic. Beyoncé is branded as a strong independant woman. A singer, businesswoman, entrepreneur, super dancer, fighting for blacks rights, and an inspiration for millions of women all over the world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In spite of this image, she&#8217;s decided to act outside the black and white dichotomy. She&#8217;s a strong woman? Sure, but she can be weak as well.</p>



<p>In a very shallow world, Beyonce brings in complexity. It doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re weak if you let your cheating husband back in. It doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re strong if you kick him out. Life is more complicated than this. And we know it because we see it everyday in our own lives.</p>



<p>You can agree or disagree with Beyoncé&#8217;s way of dealing with the situation. But it&#8217;s impossible not to admire her for her honesty. This is what authenticity is all about. Not acting like a star, but like a human being, we are weak and we are strong, we are decisive and then we change our minds. And so does our super-star. Apparently.</p>



<h3>What can we take from this story?</h3>



<p>Look, I&#8217;m not a music critic, but I know good marketing when I see it. More than anything else, this album reinforces Beyoncé&#8217;s brand. And that the most important thing in 2016 is credibility and authenticity if you want to sell something. Your services, your brand, your mission statement.<br></p>
