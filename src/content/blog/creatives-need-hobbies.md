<p>When you&#8217;re a freelance creative, chances are, your job is doing what you love. Congratulations!</p>
<p>You still need to love doing something else.</p>
<p><strong>Doing what you love every day is a great privilege. </strong>And, chances are, you earned that! But, as is the nature of the world, anything you do for money eventually becomes work. And then the magic wears off.</p>
<h3>Even sexy people have boogers</h3>
<p>The first month of full-time freelancing is an absolute joy. I don&#8217;t have to tell you the benefits of freelance vs. employee life: You work from wherever you want, whenever you want, wearing whatever you want, eating snacks and taking breaks. It&#8217;s the dopeness.</p>
<p>Also, your freelance title is probably way cooler than whatever your employee title was.</p>
<p>However, eventually the tax man will call, and &#8216;sexy designer/copywriter/translator/et al&#8217; doesn&#8217;t get any leniency from the tax man.</p>
<p>In this life, you are the sexy person, and taxes, paperwork, contracts, <a href="http://www.goprospero.com">proposals</a> et al are your boogers. You look super good from the outside, but you&#8217;ve got boogers, and sometimes they come out.</p>
<p>Basically, no matter who you work for or where you do it from, stress is stress.</p>
<p>W<strong>hen you&#8217;re up late making ends meet, that thing you love doing can pretty quickly become that thing you used to love doing.</strong></p>
<h3>Scary fact: You don&#8217;t have to be old to be burned out.</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re in love with what you do, sometimes it&#8217;s hard to stop doing it. That, combined with love of/need for $$$$, can make working too much a really big problem.</p>
<p>Saying no is a big issue for creative freelancers, for two reasons.</p>
<p>First of all, freelancing is often a &#8216;feast or famine&#8217; kind of deal. You&#8217;ll have a few months of nonstop projects, and then a month or two of forced vacation.</p>
<p>It happens to everyone. You can expect it.</p>
<p>So, if you know that&#8217;s going to happen, how can you say no to a project? You have to save up for the dark times, right? Right. That&#8217;s the responsible choice.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re making the choice to go out on your own and, like, <strong>really </strong>do this, you probably love what you do to borderline obsessiveness.</p>
<p>So, if your passion is app design, and you&#8217;re already working 100000000 hours/week but someone comes by with the coolest app ever!!!!!!!, who expects you to turn it down? Not me. I get you.</p>
<p>Eventually, though, working all those hours will get you down.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll miss your partner. You&#8217;ll miss your friends. You&#8217;ll miss the gym, reading books, sunshine, whatever you used to do for fun.</p>
<p><strong>Unless you keep doing it for fun.</strong></p>
<p>Scheduling time for the things that make you happy will not only keep you from working those way-too-many hours, but it will keep you away from the dreaded burnout.</p>
<p>Finding two things you love, and only taking money for one, will make your life balanced and whole.</p>
<h3>The satisfaction of really working for yourself</h3>
<p>When we say that, as freelancers, we work for ourselves, we all know it&#8217;s kind of a lie.</p>
<p>Maybe we make our own hours and maybe we work from home but we also have deadlines to meet and emails to answer. At best, you&#8217;re working <strong>with</strong> a lot of people.</p>
<p>Hobbies, though, are yours alone.</p>
<p>You get to do something you love at your own pace, and the results are for you. It&#8217;s something private.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no fear that the results will come out shit.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no fear that the results will come out amazing and still your client won&#8217;t be happy.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no fear, period. It&#8217;s a space for you to enjoy without stress.</p>
<p>Beyond the enjoyment, though, <strong>hobbies are for exploration</strong>. The career that you&#8217;ve chosen isn&#8217;t a whim; <strong>it&#8217;s something you know you&#8217;re good at.</strong></p>
<p>Hobbies are a space where you get to play, and the results don&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>Developing your creativity on the side, without stress or limits, will help you approach your work as another form of art &#8212; and not really work at all.</p>
<p>Make space in your life for something a little bit less serious, and you&#8217;ll find your whole attitude towards creativity changing. For the good.</p>
<h2>What&#8217;s Next?</h2>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re ready to charge more or just getting started, if you&#8217;re ready to work hard and stay organized, <a href="http://thenuschool.com/the-pricing-class/" target="_blank">The Pricing Class is for you</a>.</p>
<p>Learn what you&#8217;re worth and don&#8217;t be afraid to ask for it. Keep your head straight and your business right &#8212; and your bank account will be singing in no time.</p>
