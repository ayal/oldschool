<h3 id="subtitle">If you’re a freelancer, it’s easy to fall into the trap. For me, working all the time made me tired of what I love the most.</h3>
<p>I’ve been <strong>working freelance</strong> since 2004 (2007 full-time I guess).</p>
<p>During this time, I alternated periods of intense work (when I ran out of money) with a very relaxed work schedule (and splurging on the money I’d suddenly have).</p>
<p>Past few years, as I got older (and married), I’ve been working a lot more.</p>
<p>Working long hours is totally fine with me. The problem is, not only have I been a lot less happy, but I’ve been doing crappier work, and my passion (for web development in my case, but I think this applies to designers and other professions, too) has greatly diminished.</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about it lately. What’s going on here..? I used to breathe web development!</p>
<h3>Working too much made me a saaaad freelancer</h3>
<p>It took me a while to figure it out. I noticed that when I started my career, I was all excited and happy all the time. I sprung out of bed and couldn’t wait to start crunching code—and for peanuts, compared to what I make now.</p>
<p>Lately, I just haven’t been as passionate. I even thought that perhaps I should do something else. My whole life I just had a lot of fun coding, and then it actually started to feel like work.</p>
<p>It did take me a while to figure it out, but eventually I did.</p>
<h3>Too much of it ate away my passion</h3>
<p>I don’t know if it’s a good analogy, but if your favorite food is—let’s say—broccoli (yum!), and you just eat that every day, wouldn’t eventually get tired of it and even end up hating it?</p>
<p>I think the same can happen when you’re lucky enough to make your passion a career. You just like it so much, all you do and want to do is that.</p>
<p>I would literally work 8-10 hours on client projects, and then go home and keep working on personal stuff—and on my free time, I’d read tech books.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, I didn’t even realize it, because I was actually having fun. I would have done the same thing even if I didn’t get paid.</p>
<p>If I look at reports from my time tracking software (<a href="http://letsfreckle.com/">Freckle</a>, if you’re looking for one), I would hardly be able to find a single day where I worked 0 hours, and this would go back weeks or even months with me working at least 3h/day.</p>
<p>The thing is, as I kept doing it too much, little by little I just liked it less and less(just like in my broccoli example), and without even noticing.</p>
<p>The result—after years and years—is that I still liked web development, but I didn’tlove it anymore.</p>
<h3>The solution</h3>
<p>After much soul searching, I finally figured out that the problem wasn’t that I didn’t like web development anymore: it was just that I had overdone it for so long.</p>
<p>On top of that, my passion hadn’t disappeared, but was merely dormant, anesthetized by years and years of doing the same thing every day.</p>
<p>The solution might seem obvious (as might my problem), but I urge everyone whom—like me—didn’t realize that you need some balance, to make sure you don’t work all the time.</p>
<p>Go do something else, and as unrelated as possibile, for as long as possible.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>When you&#8217;re working freelance, it’s way too easy to never take a break from it. You have deadlines, etc. etc.</p>
<p>Find some balance. By working too much, you actually get less stuff done anyway, because you’re tired and less productive.</p>
<p>For me, overdoing it made me pretty much indifferent to web development, which instead I truly love.</p>
<p>If you’re working freelance, it’s easy to fall in the trap—if you want to keep being passionate about it, take a break from it.</p>
